Illustrates importance of using immutable objects as keys in a hashtable:


The issue lies in the equals and hashCode methods of the Employee class, which
include the visited field. This causes the removeDuplicates method to treat
employees with the same name and salary but different visited values as distinct,
leading to incorrect behavior. The inclusion of visited in these methods
introduces unnecessary complexity. The Person class is not immutable as is, so either make it immutable or remove the visited field from the equals and hashCode methods.
