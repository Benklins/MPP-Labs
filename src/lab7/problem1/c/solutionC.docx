hashCode not overridden:

While the equals method is correctly overridden, the HashMap in removeDuplicates
relies on both equals and hashCode. The Employee class does not override hashCode,
leading to inconsistent behavior when checking for duplicates in the HashMap.So in
the method removeDuplicates(List<Employee> employees), you are checking each employee against the keys of a HashMap and you did not override the hashCode, which will lead to inconsistent behavior and generating a list of duplicates and of size more than the desired answer.
