a. Compiler error occurs here: List<Number> nums = ints;
Even though Integer extends Number, List<Number> is NOT a covariant of List<Integer>. Reason "ints"
which is a type of List<Integer> cannot be assigned to List<? extends Number>


b. Compiler error occurs here: nums.add(3.14);
List<? extends Number> is a covariant of List<Integer> since Integer extends Number. However, covariants
are read-only meaning one cannot add elements! An attempt to add 3.14 leads to compiler error!
