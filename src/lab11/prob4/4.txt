a. Yes, there is compiler error.
The line nums.add(3.14) will cause a compiler error because nums is declared as ? extends Number.
When a list is declared with ? extends Number, you cannot add any elements to it because the exact
type is unknown. The compiler cannot guarantee that 3.14 (a Double) is compatible with the list
type (List<Integer> in this case).

b. Compiler Error:
The error occurs at double dbl = sum(ints); because ints is of type List<? super Integer>, which is
incompatible with the expected parameter type Collection<? extends Number> for the sum method.
